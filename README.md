# LEDE-homework

This is a repository for the homework we did on the LEDE Program at Columbia J School, for using APIs. 

It includes three Jupyter notebooks:
- Part 1 uses the Google API for location and then Geocoder library to get latitude and longitude for certain addresses.
- Part 2 uses an API for weather, with current weather and forecasts. 
- Part 4 uses the Spotify API and (Spotipy library)[https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.25.1/] to find info on a certain playlist.
