# LEDE-homework

This is a repository that will include all homework from the LEDE program, in Columbia Journalism School. I am Estefan√≠a Celi, an ecuadorian investigative journalist studying this program in summer 2025.

In this repository you will find homework on Python, data analysis, APIs, scraping and a lot of other things.
